# PhishingTest
<p>graduate capstone course project</p>
<p>Completed my Master's of Science in Management Information Systems at University of Illinois at Springfield in 2021</p>
<p>For the capstone course, worked with a group to do a phishing test for a local business. The overall project and paper was done by the entire group, but the metrics and the final client deliverable was exclusively my work.</p>
