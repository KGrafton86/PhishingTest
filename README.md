# PhishingTest
graduate capstone course project

Completed my Master's of Science in Management Information Systems at University of Illinois at Springfield in 2021

For the capstone course, worked with a group to do a phishing test for a local business. The overall project and paper was done by the entire group, but the metrics and the final client deliverable was exclusively my work.
